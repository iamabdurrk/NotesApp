## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- SQLite (or any other database, depending on your configuration)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamabdurrk/NotesApp.git
cd notes-application
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set Up the Database

Run the following commands to set up the SQLite database:

```bash
python
>>> from database import initialize_db
>>> initialize_db()
>>> exit()
```

This will create the required tables for the application.

### Running the Application

After setting up the database, run the Flask application:

```bash
flask run
```

Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the Notes Application.
